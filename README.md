# warclock
## An Adafruit MONOCHRON clock module inspired by the movie WarGames and the WOPR computer.
## Built using the [Emuchron](https://github.com/tceulema/Emuchron) tool and firmware from Toine Ceulemans.

Just add warclock.c and warclock.h to your Emuchron clocks directory and update the rest of the files according to the Emuchron instructions.

The Game Time Elapsed screen shows the current time. Game Time Remaining a countdown until the set alarm time. Arming the alarm adds ARMED and the alarm time to both screens.
