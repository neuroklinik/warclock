# warclock
## An Adafruit MONOCHRON clock module inspired by the movie WarGames and the WOPR computer.
## Built using the [Emuchron](https://github.com/tceulema/Emuchron) tool and firmware from Toine Ceulemans.

Just add warclock.c and warclock.h to your Emuchron clocks directory and update the rest of the files according to the Emuchron instructions.

A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpwfySqux5M) of the clock module in action (minus the DEFCON 1! alarm).
